# domained â€“ Multi Tool Subdomain Enumeration Suite on Kali Linux

  Information Gathering is the crucial step in the process of penetration testing. 
  The more you collect the information the more it will help you to get a better testing methodology.
  So for this purpose of Information Gathering, the Domained tool is created. Domained is a framework collection of various subdomain detection tools. Domained is a python language-based tool that uses several
  subdomain enumeration tools and wordlists to create a unique list of subdomains passed to the EyeWitness tool for reporting with categorized snapshots, server response headers, and signature-based default
  credentials checking.
  Several tools are integrated with the Domained tool that covers the enumeration phase, reporting, and wordlists. Domained tools will allow the penetration tester to verify the target against different programs.
